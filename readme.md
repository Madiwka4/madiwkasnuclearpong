# About
This is a normal pong clone, wuth a couple interesting tweaks. 

# Tweaks
Added NuclearScore. NuclearScore gets increased when you succesfully deflect a ball, +10 by default, but, if the ball was striked, it instead increases geometrically. 
Added "strike abilities", which allow you to speed up the ball depending on how much NuclearScore you have gathered. After the ball has been striked, it speeds up every time it's hit until someone misses! (press S when available)
Added time slowdowns. If you have 140 NuclearScore, and the ball is moving in your direction on your half of the field, you can slow down time in order to give yourself breathing room to hit the ball. Slowing down time gradually decrases your NuclearScore. (press X when available)
Added NUKES. When your counter is RED, you can press your (S) or any key that you have set to turn your ball into a NUKE. It changes the field, an makes the ball go ultra-fast. 
Added balancing. Losing by a huge margin? Don't worry, your opponent will get debuffs, and you will get buffs until the score is equalized. 
Added Editor. You can make your own Pong maps!

The default controls are [A]/[Z] - UP/DOWN, [S]/[X] - Special/Time (for player 1), [;]/[.] - UP/DOWN, [L]/[,] - Special/Time (for player 2)
