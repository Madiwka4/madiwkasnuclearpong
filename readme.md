# Changes
<p>0.7.6 is here! With this update, I improved the AI, allowing it to follow 2 balls at the same time! I also added "Smart" difficulty, where the AI uses physics and math to pre-calculate where the ball is going to land. Alpha-testing of the Online gameplay is now here, although its stupid and doesnt work. </p>
